Play with parsers in scala

Haskellers who think Scala is wussy should read this. 

It's a monadic parser in which for...yield accidentally volunteered itself to act as do...return.

Scalaz does this properly, but people who want their code that similar to Haskell would simply use Haskell. The world needs to get there via lighter techniques.
